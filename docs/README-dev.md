# Building the docs

This project uses [Sphinx Theme](https://sphinx-theme.scylladb.com/) , but we have modified the base project to adapt it to our workflows.

## Local preview

To build the documentation locally, run `make setup` first to install its dependencies.

Then, you can build and preview the documentation by following the steps outlined in the [Quickstart guide](https://sphinx-theme.scylladb.com/stable/getting-started/quickstart.html).
